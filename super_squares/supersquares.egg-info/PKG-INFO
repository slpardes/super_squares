# Super Squares

Super Squares is a tool that allows anyone to generate and randomly assign Super Bowl squares.

## Prerequisites

- You have read the documentation 

## Installing Super Squares

To install Super Squares, follow these steps on all OS devices:

1. Install using the following command: `pip install supersquares`
2. Import with: `from supersquares import squares`

## Usage Example

1. Create a Squares() instance and name it `pr_squares` using the following command: `pr_squares = Squares()`
2. To specify requirements for the pool, modify the line above to include the desireced variables: `pr_squares = Squares(cost_per_square = 10, team_a = "Pawnee", team_b = "Eagleton")`
3. Check out the specifications with the `SquareStats()` function. For example, `pr_squares.SquareStats()` would generate: 
```
Number of rows: 10
Number of columns: 10
Minimum number of squares: None
Maximum number of squares: None
Team A: Pawnee
Team B: Eagleton
Cost per square: $10
Total pot: $1000
	Q1 payout: 15%, $150.0

	Q3 payout: 15%, $150.0
	Final Score payout: 40%, $400.0
Available squares: 100

## FAQ

### What variables can be modified?
min/max, cost per square, payout percentages, team names, grid size

### Why can't I manually choose squares?
Accoring to [sportingnews.com](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/super-bowl-squares-grid-2023-best-numbers/ltur0ayv6wvsdkyjjk2cnmdo) , as of 2022, in the history of the Super Bowl, the four best combinations have been 0-0 (19 times), 0-3 (13 times), 0-7 (11 times) and 7-0 (10 times) and 3-7 (10 times)

Squares are assigned randomly to fairly distribute squares with a greater chance of winning.
